* How to install and set up Memacs

** *Obtain Memacs*

- using one of github download mechanisms *OR*
- use ~pip install memacs~ which handles dependencies
  - you might as well want to use [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv][virtualenv]] before
- make sure that you have *Python v2.7* installed

*** Installing Using virtualenv and PIP (recommended!)

I installed [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memacs][Memacs using PIP]] with the following commands:

First, I created a virtualenv environment using a local installation
of Python 2.7 (you can use the Python installation of your site of
course):
: ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/virtualenv.py -p /home/karl/bin/Python-2.7.2/bin/python memacs

I entered the folder ~cd memacs~ and activated the environment
~. bin/activate~.
After that, I installed Memacs using PIP with ~pip install memacs~

Within this activated virtualenv, PYTHONPATH is set correctly and I am
able to start any module directly like
: ~/src/memacs/bin/memacs_rss.py -u ...

Summary:
: ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/virtualenv.py -p /home/karl/bin/Python-2.7.2/bin/python memacs
: cd memacs
: . bin/activate
: pip install memacs
: ~/src/memacs/bin/memacs_rss.py --help

You don't have to activate the virtualenv for further calls. Just
start the modules located in the bin-folder of Memacs.

**** Updating PIP-Memacs

: cd memacs
: . bin/activate
: pip install memacs --upgrade

*** Installing on OS X with homebrew without virtualenv

If you decide not to use virtualenv (not recommended), you are
probably interested in [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs/issues/8#issuecomment-16441471][a comment of a user who described the manualprocess here]] .

** *Choose* the *modules* you want to use

- read the files in the ~docs~ folder
- start the modules from the ~bin~ folder of Memacs

** *Set up one module* after another

- please make sure you read [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs/blob/master/docs/FAQs_and_Best_Practices.org][docs/FAQs_and_Best_Practices.org]]
  - it contains many tips and tricks on how to meet your
    requirements and on how to choose a reasonable setup
- start the module of your choice with the argument ~--help~
  - modules are located in the ~bin~ sub-folder
  - for example: ~/memacs/bin % ./memacs_svn.py --help~
  - each module has some general arguments and module-specific arguments
- you probably want to *develop and test a module invocation* in the
  command line and when it works:
- set up a periodical invocation
  - read the [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs/blob/master/docs/FAQs_and_Best_Practices.org#invocation][Invocation]] section of [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs/blob/master/docs/FAQs_and_Best_Practices.org][docs/FAQs_and_Best_Practices.org]]
