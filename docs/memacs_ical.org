** Options

- ~-c~, ~--calendar-url~, url to calendar
- ~-cf~, ~--calendar-file~, path to calendar
- ~-x~, ~--exclude~, path to one or more folders separated with ~|~

** Data Source
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar][ICalendar]] is a widely used format for defining calendars.
A lot of Calendar-Services like i.e. Google give you a *private* url of your calendar, which you can easily use with this module.

** Requirements
- icalendar Python package
  install it with
  : $ easy install icalendar

** Example Invocation:

*** Calendar at a url

: /path/to/Memacs/calendars/memacs_calendar.py -c "http://example.com/foo.ics" -o "/home/user/orgmode/memacs/calendar.org_archive"

*** Calendar file

: /path/to/Memacs/calendars/memacs_calendar.py -cf "/home/user/calendars/private.ics" -o "/home/user/orgmode/memacs/calendar.org_archive"

* What will not work
- Repeating events
  Because Org-mode doesn't support repeating events in datetime ranges
